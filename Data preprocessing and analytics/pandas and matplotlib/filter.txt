COMM DISCLAIMER
COMM ----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMM It is Fugro Airborne Survey’s understanding that the data provided to
COMM the client is to be used for the purpose agreed between the parties.
COMM That purpose was a significant factor in determining the scope and
COMM level of the Services being offered to the Client. Should the purpose
COMM for which the data is used change, the data may no longer be valid or
COMM appropriate and any further use of, or reliance upon, the data in
COMM those circumstances by the Client without Fugro Airborne Survey's
COMM review and advice shall be at the Client's own or sole risk.
COMM
COMM The Services were performed by Fugro Airborne Survey exclusively for
COMM the purposes of the Client. Should the data be made available in whole
COMM or part to any third party, and such party relies thereon, that party
COMM does so wholly at its own and sole risk and Fugro Airborne Survey
COMM disclaims any liability to such party.
COMM
COMM Where the Services have involved Fugro Airborne Survey's use of any
COMM information provided by the Client or third parties, upon which
COMM Fugro Airborne Survey was reasonably entitled to rely, then the
COMM Services are limited by the accuracy of such information. Fugro
COMM Airborne Survey is not liable for any inaccuracies (including any
COMM incompleteness) in the said information, save as otherwise provided
COMM in the terms of the contract between the Client and Fugro Airborne
COMM Survey.
COMM
COMM With regard to DIGITAL TERRAIN DATA, the accuracy of the elevation
COMM calculation is directly dependent on the accuracy of the two input
COMM parameters lidar altitude and GPS altitude. The radar altitude value may be
COMM erroneous in areas of heavy tree cover, where the altimeter reflects the
COMM distance to the tree canopy rather than the ground. The GPS altitude value
COMM is primarily dependent on the number of available satellites. Although
COMM post-processing of GPS data will yield X and Y accuracies in the
COMM order of 1-2 metres, the accuracy of the altitude value is usually
COMM much less, sometimes in the ±5 metre range.  Further inaccuracies
COMM may be introduced during the interpolation and gridding process.
COMM Because of the inherent inaccuracies of this method, no guarantee is
COMM made or implied that the information displayed is a true
COMM representation of the height above sea level.  Although this product
COMM may be of some use as a general reference,
COMM THIS PRODUCT MUST NOT BE USED FOR NAVIGATION PURPOSES.

COMM PULSE WIDTH: 10 ms
COMM
COMM TEMPEST EM data are transformed to the response that would be
COMM obtained with a B-field sensor for a 100% duty cycle square
COMM waveform at the base frequency, involving a 1A change in
COMM current (from -0.5A to +0.5A to -0.5A) in a 1sq.m transmitter.
COMM It is this configuration, rather than the actual acquisition
COMM configuration, which must be specified when modelling TEMPEST data.
