0,Transient Stability Assessment of Power Systems Based on Local Learning Machine and Bacterial Colony Chemotaxis Algorithm,"['Xueping Gu', 'Yang Li']","In order to improve the classification accuracy of transient stability assessment of power systems, a novel method based on local learning machine and an improved bacterial colony chemotaxis (BCC) algorithm is proposed, where local learning machine(LLM) is used to build a TSA model. Considering the possible real-time information provided by PMU, a group of system-level classification features extracted from the power system operation parameters are employed as inputs, and the stability result is used as output of the LLM model. The relation ship between input and output is trained and the ideal model is obtained by applying the improved BCC combined with chaotic search strategy to determine the optimal parameters of LLM automatically. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by the simulation results on the New England 10-unit-39-bus power system.

1,Approximating power of machine-learning ansatz for quantum many-body states,"['Artem Borin', 'Dmitry A. Abanin']","An artificial neural network (ANN) with the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) architecture was recently proposed as a versatile variational quantum many-body wave function. In this work we provide physical insights into the performance of this ansatz. We uncover the connection between the structure of RBM and perturbation series, which explains the excellent precision achieved by RBM ansazt in certain simple models, demonstrated in the literature. Based on this relation, we improve the numerical algorithm to achieve better performance of RBM in cases where local minima complicate the convergence to the global one. We introduce other classes of variational wave-functions, which are also capable of reproducing the perturbative structure, and show that their performance is comparable to that of RBM. Furthermore, we study the performance of a few-layer RBM for approximating ground states of random, translationally-invariant models in 1d, as well as random matrix-product states (MPS). We find that the error in approximating such states exhibits a broad distribution, and is largely determined by the entanglement properties of the targeted state.

2,When Machine Learning Meets Big Data: A Wireless Communication Perspective,"['Yuanwei Liu', 'Suzhi Bi', 'Zhiyuan Shi', 'Lajos Hanzo']","We have witnessed an exponential growth in commercial data services, which has lead to the big data's era. Machine learning, as one of the most promising artificial intelligence tools of analyzing the deluge of data, has been invoked in many research areas both in academia and industry. The aim of this article is twin-fold. Firstly, we review big data analysis and machine learning, along with their potential applications in wireless networks. The second goal is to invoke big data analysis to predict the requirements of mobile users and to exploit it for improving the performance of wireless networks. More particularly, a unified big data aided machine learning framework is proposed, which consists of feature extraction, data modeling and prediction/online refinement. The main benefits of the proposed framework are that by relying on big data which reflects the real requirements of users, we can refine the motivation, problem formulations, and methodology of powerful machine learning algorithms in the context of wireless networks. To characterize the efficiency of the proposed framework, a pair of practical case studies are provided: 1) To predict the positioning of drone-mounted areal base stations (BSs) deployments according to specific tele-traffic requirements. 2) To predict the content caching requirements of BSs according to the users' preferences. Finally, open research opportunities are identified for motivating future investigations.

3,Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms for Bearing Fault Diagnostics - A Comprehensive Review,"['Shen Zhang', 'Shibo Zhang', 'Bingnan Wang', 'Thomas G. Habetler']","In this survey paper, we systematically summarize the current literature on studies that apply machine learning (ML) and data mining techniques to bearing fault diagnostics. Conventional ML methods, including artificial neural network (ANN), principal component analysis (PCA), support vector machines (SVM), etc., have been successfully applied to detecting and categorizing bearing faults since the last decade, while the application of deep learning (DL) methods has sparked great interest in both the industry and academia in the last five years. In this paper, we will first review the conventional ML methods, before taking a deep dive into the latest developments in DL algorithms for bearing fault applications. Specifically, the superiority of the DL based methods over the conventional ML methods are analyzed in terms of metrics directly related to fault feature extraction and classifier performances; the new functionalities offered by DL techniques that cannot be accomplished before are also summarized. In addition, to obtain a more intuitive insight, a comparative study is performed on the classifier performance and accuracy for a number of papers utilizing the open source Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing data set. Finally, based on the nature of the time-series 1-D data obtained from sensors monitoring the bearing conditions, recommendations and suggestions are provided to applying DL algorithms on bearing fault diagnostics based on specific applications, as well as future research directions to further improve its performance.

4,PD-ML-Lite: Private Distributed Machine Learning from Lighweight Cryptography,"['Maksim Tsikhanovich', 'Malik Magdon-Ismail', 'Muhammad Ishaq', 'Vassilis Zikas']","Privacy is a major issue in learning from distributed data. Recently the cryptographic literature has provided several tools for this task. However, these tools either reduce the quality/accuracy of the learning algorithm---e.g., by adding noise---or they incur a high performance penalty and/or involve trusting external authorities.
  We propose a methodology for {\sl private distributed machine learning from light-weight cryptography} (in short, PD-ML-Lite). We apply our methodology to two major ML algorithms, namely non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and singular value decomposition (SVD). Our resulting protocols are communication optimal, achieve the same accuracy as their non-private counterparts, and satisfy a notion of privacy---which we define---that is both intuitive and measurable. Our approach is to use lightweight cryptographic protocols (secure sum and normalized secure sum) to build learning algorithms rather than wrap complex learning algorithms in a heavy-cost MPC framework.
  We showcase our algorithms' utility and privacy on several applications: for NMF we consider topic modeling and recommender systems, and for SVD, principal component regression, and low rank approximation.

5,Machine Learning for Wireless Communications in the Internet of Things: A Comprehensive Survey,"['Jithin Jagannath', 'Nicholas Polosky', 'Anu Jagannath', 'Francesco Restuccia', 'Tommaso Melodia']","The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to require more effective and efficient wireless communications than ever before. For this reason, techniques such as spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum access will soon become essential components of the IoT wireless communication process. In this vision, IoT devices must be able to not only learn to autonomously extract spectrum knowledge on-the-fly from the network but also leverage such knowledge to dynamically change appropriate wireless parameters (e.g., frequency band, symbol modulation, coding rate, route selection etc) to reach the network's optimal operating point. To address the above challenges, much research has been devoted to exploring the use of machine learning to address problems in the IoT wireless communications domain. The reason behind machine learning's popularity is that it provides a general framework to solve very complex problems where a model of the phenomenon being learned is too complex to derive or too dynamic to be summarized in mathematical terms. This work provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in the application of machine learning techniques to address key problems in IoT wireless communications with an emphasis on its ad hoc networking aspect. First, we present extensive background notions on machine learning techniques. Then, by adopting a bottom-up approach, we examine existing work on machine learning for the IoT at the physical, data-link and network layer of the protocol stack. Thereafter, we discuss directions taken by the community towards hardware implementation to ensure the feasibility of these techniques. Finally, we provide a series of research challenges associated with the applications of machine learning techniques for IoT wireless communications.

6,Characterization of photoexcited states in the half-filled one-dimensional extended Hubbard model assisted by machine learning,"['Kazuya Shinjo', 'Shigetoshi Sota', 'Seiji Yunoki', 'Takami Tohyama']","Photoinduced nonequilibrium states can provide new insights into the dynamical properties in strongly correlated electron systems. One of the typical and extensively studied systems is the half-filled one-dimensional extended Hubbard model (1DEHM). Here, we propose that the supervised machine learning (ML) can give useful information for characterizing the photoexcited state in 1DEHM. Using entanglement spectra as a training dataset, we construct the neural network. Judging from the trained network, we find that the quantum state driven by driving pulse has bond-spin-density wave (BSDW) order for U\lesssim2VU\lesssim2V, where UU (VV) is the on-site (nearest-neighbor) Coulomb interaction. We separately calculate the time evolution of order parameters and find that the order parameters of BSDW are actually enhanced by photoexcitation as predicted by ML. Interestingly, the enhancement of the BSDW order in the photoexcited states for the 1DEHM has never been reported previously, despite the extensive studies so far, thus demonstrating the advantage of ML to assist characterizing photoexcited quantum states.

8,Micro-UAV Detection and Classification from RF Fingerprints Using Machine Learning Techniques,"['Martins Ezuma', 'Fatih Erden', 'Chethan Kumar Anjinappa', 'Ozgur Ozdemir', 'Ismail Guvenc']","This paper focuses on the detection and classification of micro-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using radio frequency (RF) fingerprints of the signals transmitted from the controller to the micro-UAV. In the detection phase, raw signals are split into frames and transformed into the wavelet domain. A Markov models-based naive Bayes approach is used to check for the presence of a UAV in each frame. In the classification phase, unlike the traditional approaches that rely solely on time-domain signals and corresponding features, the proposed technique uses the energy transient signal. This approach is more robust to noise and can cope with different modulation techniques. First, the normalized energy trajectory is generated from the energy-time-frequency distribution of the raw control signal. Next, the start and end points of the energy transient are detected by searching for the most abrupt changes in the mean of the energy trajectory. Then, a set of statistical features is extracted from the energy transient. Significant features are selected by performing neighborhood component analysis (NCA) to keep the computational cost of the algorithm low. Finally, selected features are fed to several machine learning algorithms for classification. The algorithms are evaluated experimentally using a database containing 100 RF signals from each of 14 different UAV controllers. The signals are recorded wirelessly using a high-frequency oscilloscope. The data set is randomly partitioned into training and test sets for validation with the ratio 4:1. Ten Monte Carlo simulations are run and results are averaged to assess the performance of the methods. All the micro-UAVs are detected correctly and an average accuracy of 96.3% is achieved using the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification. Proposed methods are also tested for different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels and results are reported.

9,What Can Machine Learning Teach Us about Communications?,"['Mengke Lian', 'Christian Häger', 'Henry D. Pfister']","Rapid improvements in machine learning over the past decade are beginning to have far-reaching effects. For communications, engineers with limited domain expertise can now use off-the-shelf learning packages to design high-performance systems based on simulations. Prior to the current revolution in machine learning, the majority of communication engineers were quite aware that system parameters (such as filter coefficients) could be learned using stochastic gradient descent. It was not at all clear, however, that more complicated parts of the system architecture could be learned as well. In this paper, we discuss the application of machine-learning techniques to two communications problems and focus on what can be learned from the resulting systems. We were pleasantly surprised that the observed gains in one example have a simple explanation that only became clear in hindsight. In essence, deep learning discovered a simple and effective strategy that had not been considered earlier.

The genetic fuzzy markup language (GFML)-based Robot Agent can work on various kinds of robots, including Palro, Pepper, and TMUs robots. We use the parameters of FAIR open source Darkforest and OpenGo AI bots to construct the knowledge base of Open Go Darkforest (OGD) cloud platform for student learning on the Internet. In addition, we adopt the data from AlphaGo Master sixty online games as the training data to construct the knowledge base and rule base of the co-learning system. First, the Darkforest predicts the win rate based on various simulation numbers and matching rates for each game on OGD platform, then the win rate of OpenGo is as the final desired output. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can improve knowledge base and rule base of the prediction ability based on Darkforest and OpenGo AI bot with various simulation numbers.

Marques', 'E. Clua']","Morphological classification is a key piece of information to define samples of galaxies aiming to study the large-scale structure of the universe. In essence, the challenge is to build up a robust methodology to perform a reliable morphological estimate from galaxy images. Here, we investigate how to substantially improve the galaxy classification within large datasets by mimicking human classification. We combine accurate visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project with machine and deep learning methodologies. We propose two distinct approaches for galaxy morphology: one based on non-parametric morphology and traditional machine learning algorithms; and another based on Deep Learning. To measure the input features for the traditional machine learning methodology, we have developed a system called CyMorph, with a novel non-parametric approach to study galaxy morphology. The main dataset employed comes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7). We also discuss the class imbalance problem considering three classes. Performance of each model is mainly measured by Overall Accuracy (OA). A spectroscopic validation with astrophysical parameters is also provided for Decision Tree models to assess the quality of our morphological classification. In all of our samples, both Deep and Traditional Machine Learning approaches have over 94.5% OA to classify galaxies among 2 classes (elliptical and spiral galaxies). We provide a catalog with ~670,000 galaxies containing our best results, including morphological metrics and classification (supplementary data link). We compare our classification with state-of-art morphological classification from literature.

13,Machine learning assisted measurement of local topological invariants,"['Marcello D. Caio', 'Marco Caccin', 'Paul Baireuther', 'Timo Hyart', 'Michel Fruchart']","The continuous effort towards topological quantum devices calls for an efficient and non-invasive method to assess the conformity of components in different topological phases. Here, we show that machine learning paves the way towards non-invasive topological quality control. To do so, we use a local topological marker, able to discriminate between topological phases of one-dimensional wires. The direct observation of this marker in solid state systems is challenging, but we show that an artificial neural network can learn to approximate it from the experimentally accessible local density of states. Our method distinguishes different non-trivial phases, even for systems where direct transport measurements are not available and for composite systems. This new approach could find significant use in experiments, ranging from the study of novel topological materials to high-throughput automated material design.

Garikipati']","The free energy of a system is central to many material models. Although free energy data is not generally found directly, its derivatives can be observed or calculated. In this work, we present an Integrable Deep Neural Network (IDNN) that can be trained to derivative data, then analytically integrated to recover an accurate representation of the free energy. The IDNN is demonstrated by training to the chemical potential values of a binary alloy with B2 ordering. The resulting DNN representation of the free energy is used in a phase field simulation and found to predict the appropriate formation of antiphase boundaries in the material. In contrast, a B-spline representation of the same data failed to represent the physics of the system with sufficient fidelity to resolve the antiphase boundaries.

16,PlayeRank: data-driven performance evaluation and player ranking in soccer via a machine learning approach,"['Luca Pappalardo', 'Paolo Cintia', 'Paolo Ferragina', 'Emanuele Massucco', 'Dino Pedreschi', 'Fosca Giannotti']","The problem of evaluating the performance of soccer players is attracting the interest of many companies and the scientific community, thanks to the availability of massive data capturing all the events generated during a match (e.g., tackles, passes, shots, etc.). Unfortunately, there is no consolidated and widely accepted metric for measuring performance quality in all of its facets. In this paper, we design and implement PlayeRank, a data-driven framework that offers a principled multi-dimensional and role-aware evaluation of the performance of soccer players. We build our framework by deploying a massive dataset of soccer-logs and consisting of millions of match events pertaining to four seasons of 18 prominent soccer competitions. By comparing PlayeRank to known algorithms for performance evaluation in soccer, and by exploiting a dataset of players' evaluations made by professional soccer scouts, we show that PlayeRank significantly outperforms the competitors. We also explore the ratings produced by {\sf PlayeRank} and discover interesting patterns about the nature of excellent performances and what distinguishes the top players from the others. At the end, we explore some applications of PlayeRank -- i.e. searching players and player versatility --- showing its flexibility and efficiency, which makes it worth to be used in the design of a scalable platform for soccer analytics.

17,Machine Learning Modeling of Wigner Intracule Functionals for Two Electrons in One Dimension,"['Rutvij Vihang Bhavsar', 'Raghunathan Ramakrishnan']","In principle, many-electron correlation energy can be precisely computed from a reduced Wigner distribution function (\mathcal{W}\mathcal{W}) thanks to a universal functional transformation (\mathcal{F}\mathcal{F}), whose formal existence is akin to that of the exchange-correlation functional in density functional theory. While the exact dependence of \mathcal{F}\mathcal{F} on \mathcal{W}\mathcal{W} is unknown, a few approximate parametric models have been proposed in the past. Here, for a dataset of 923 one-dimensional external potentials with two interacting electrons, we apply machine learning to model \mathcal{F}\mathcal{F} within the kernel Ansatz. We deal with over-fitting of the kernel to a specific region of phase-space by a one-step regularization not depending on any hyperparameters. Reference correlation energies have been computed by performing exact and Hartree--Fock calculations using discrete variable representation. The resulting models require \mathcal{W}\mathcal{W} calculated at the Hartree--Fock level as input while yielding monotonous decay in the predicted correlation energies of new molecules reaching sub-chemical accuracy with training.
