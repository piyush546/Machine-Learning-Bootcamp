0,Inference of a Multi-Domain Machine Learning Model to Predict Mortality in Hospital Stays for Patients with Cancer upon Febrile Neutropenia Onset,"['Xinsong Du', 'Jae Min', 'Dominick J. Lemas', 'Mattia Prosperi']","Febrile neutropenia (FN) has been associated with high mortality, especially among adults with cancer. Understanding the patient and provider level heterogeneity in FN hospital admissions has potential to inform personalized interventions focused on increasing survival of individuals with FN. We leverage machine learning techniques to disentangling the complex interactions among multi domain risk factors in a population with FN. Data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample and Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) were used to build machine learning based models of mortality for adult cancer patients who were diagnosed with FN during a hospital admission. In particular, the importance of risk factors from different domains (including demographic, clinical, and hospital associated information) was studied. A set of more interpretable (decision tree, logistic regression) as well as more black box (random forest, gradient boosting, neural networks) models were analyzed and compared via multiple cross validation. Our results demonstrate that a linear prediction score of FN mortality among adults with cancer, based on admission information is effective in classifying high risk patients; clinical diagnoses is the domain with the highest predictive power. A number of the risk variables (e.g. sepsis, kidney failure, etc.) identified in this study are clinically actionable and may inform future studies looking at the patients prior medical history are warranted.

1,Evaluating the optical classification of Fermi BCUs using machine learning,"['Shi-Ju Kang', 'Junhui Fan', 'Weiming Mao', 'Qingwen Wu', 'Jianchao Feng', 'Yue Yin']","In the third catalog of active galactic nuclei detected by the Fermi-LAT (3LAC) Clean Sample, there are 402 blazars candidates of uncertain type (BCU). Due to the limitations of astronomical observation or intrinsic properties, it is difficult to classify blazars using optical spectroscopy. The potential classification of BCUs using machine learning algorithms is essential. Based on the 3LAC Clean Sample, we collect 1420 Fermi blazars with 8 parameters of ?-ray photon spectral index, radio flux, flux density, curve significance, the integral photon flux in 100 to 300 MeV, 0.3 to 1 GeV, 10 to 100 GeV and variability index. Here, we apply 4 different supervised machine learning (SML) algorithms (\emph{Decision trees, Random forests, support vector machines and Mclust Gaussian finite mixture models}) to evaluate the classification of BCUs based on the direct observational properties. All the 4 methods can perform exceedingly well with a more accuracy and can effective forecast the classification of Fermi BCUs. The evaluating results show the results of these methods (SML) are valid and robust, where, about 1/4 sources are FSRQs and 3/4 are BL Lacs in 400 BCUs, which are consistent with some other recent results. Although a number of factors influence the accuracy of SML, the results are stable at a fixed ratio 1:3 between FSRQs and BL Lacs, which suggests that the SML can provides an effective method to evaluate the potential classification of BCUs. Among the 4 methods, Mclust Gaussian Mixture Modelling has the highest accuracy for our training sample (4/5, seed=123).

2,Machine Learning Techniques to Detecting and Preventing Jamming Attacks in Optical Networks,"['Mounir Bensalem', 'Sandeep Kumar Singh', 'Admela Jukan']","We study the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques, including artificial neural networks, support vector machine, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, decision tree and Naive Bayesian, for detecting and mitigating power jamming attacks in optical networks. Our study shows that artificial neural network is the most accurate in detecting out-of-band power jamming attacks in optical networks. To further mitigating the power jamming attacks, we apply a new resource reallocation scheme that utilizes the statistical information of attack detection accuracy, and propose a resource reallocation algorithm to lower the probability of successful jamming of lightpaths. Simulation results show that higher the accuracy of detection, lower is the likelihood of jamming a lightpath.

4,Identification of Bugs and Vulnerabilities in TLS Implementation for Windows Operating System Using State Machine Learning,"['Tarun Yadav', 'Koustav Sadhukhan']","TLS protocol is an essential part of secure Internet communication. In past, many attacks have been identified on the protocol. Most of these attacks are due to flaws in protocol implementation. The flaws are due to improper design and implementation of program logic by programmers. One of the widely used implementation of TLS is SChannel which is used in Windows operating system since its inception. We have used protocol state fuzzing to identify vulnerable and undesired state transitions in the state machine of the protocol for various versions of SChannel. The client as well as server components have been analyzed thoroughly using this technique and various flaws have been discovered in the implementation. Exploitation of these flaws under specific circumstances may lead to serious attacks which could disrupt secure communication. In this paper, we analyze state machine models of TLS protocol implementation of SChannel library and describe weaknesses and design flaws in these models, found using protocol state fuzzing.

5,Machine-Learning-Assisted Directed Protein Evolution with Combinatorial Libraries,"['Zachary Wu', 'S. B. Jennifer Kan', 'Russell D. Lewis', 'Bruce J. Wittmann', 'Frances H. Arnold']","To reduce experimental effort associated with directed protein evolution and to explore the sequence space encoded by mutating multiple positions simultaneously, we incorporate machine learning in the directed evolution workflow. Combinatorial sequence space can be quite expensive to sample experimentally, but machine learning models trained on tested variants provide a fast method for testing sequence space computationally. We validate this approach on a large published empirical fitness landscape for human GB1 binding protein, demonstrating that machine learning-guided directed evolution finds variants with higher fitness than those found by other directed evolution approaches. We then provide an example application in evolving an enzyme to produce each of the two possible product enantiomers (stereodivergence) of a new-to-nature carbene Si-H insertion reaction. The approach predicted libraries enriched in functional enzymes and fixed seven mutations in two rounds of evolution to identify variants for selective catalysis with 93% and 79% ee. By greatly increasing throughput with in silico modeling, machine learning enhances the quality and diversity of sequence solutions for a protein engineering problem.

6,Automating the Construction of Jet Observables with Machine Learning,"['Kaustuv Datta', 'Andrew Larkoski', 'Benjamin Nachman']","Machine-learning assisted jet substructure tagging techniques have the potential to significantly improve searches for new particles and Standard Model measurements in hadronic final states. Techniques with simple analytic forms are particularly useful for establishing robustness and gaining physical insight. We introduce a procedure to automate the construction of a large class of observables that are chosen to completely specify MM-body phase space. The procedure is validated on the task of distinguishing H\rightarrow b\bar{b}H\rightarrow b\bar{b} from g\rightarrow b\bar{b}g\rightarrow b\bar{b}, where M=3M=3 and previous brute-force approaches have established the baseline performance. We then use the new method to design tailored observables for the boosted Z'Z' search, where M=4M=4 and brute-force methods are intractable. The new classifiers outperform standard 22-prong tagging observables, illustrating the power of the new optimization method for improving searches and measurement at the LHC and beyond.

7,Machine learning of Markovian embedding for non-Markovian quantum dynamics,"['I. A. Luchnikov', 'S. V. Vintskevich', 'D. A. Grigoriev', 'S. N. Filippov']","Machine learning methods have proved to be useful for the recognition of patterns in statistical data. The measurement outcomes are intrinsically random in quantum physics, however they do have a pattern when the measurements are performed successively on an open quantum system. This pattern is due to the system-environment interaction and contains information about the relaxation rates as well as non-Markovian memory effects. Here we develop a method to extract the information about the unknown environment from a series of single-shot measurements on the system (without resorting to the process tomography). The method is based on embedding the non-Markovian system dynamics into a Markovian dynamics of the system and the effective reservoir of finite dimension. The generator of Markovian embedding is learned by the maximum likelihood estimation. We verify the method by comparing its prediction with an exactly solvable non-Markovian dynamics. The developed algorithm to learn unknown quantum environments enables one to efficiently control and manipulate quantum systems.

Mulvenna', 'Mykola Galushka', 'Bethany Waterhouse Bradley', 'Fiona Browne', 'Hui Wang', 'Alexander Wong']","Many industries are now investing heavily in data science and automation to replace manual tasks and/or to help with decision making, especially in the realm of leveraging computer vision to automate many monitoring, inspection, and surveillance tasks. This has resulted in the emergence of the 'data scientist' who is conversant in statistical thinking, machine learning (ML), computer vision, and computer programming. However, as ML becomes more accessible to the general public and more aspects of ML become automated, applications leveraging computer vision are increasingly being created by non-experts with less opportunity for regulatory oversight. This points to the overall need for more educated responsibility for these lay-users of usable ML tools in order to mitigate potentially unethical ramifications. In this paper, we undertake a SWOT analysis to study the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of building usable ML tools for mass adoption for important areas leveraging ML such as computer vision. The paper proposes a set of data science literacy criteria for educating and supporting lay-users in the responsible development and deployment of ML applications.

10,Using Machine Learning to Guide Cognitive Modeling: A Case Study in Moral Reasoning,"['Mayank Agrawal', 'Joshua C. Peterson', 'Thomas L. Griffiths']","Large-scale behavioral datasets enable researchers to use complex machine learning algorithms to better predict human behavior, yet this increased predictive power does not always lead to a better understanding of the behavior in question. In this paper, we outline a data-driven, iterative procedure that allows cognitive scientists to use machine learning to generate models that are both interpretable and accurate. We demonstrate this method in the domain of moral decision-making, where standard experimental approaches often identify relevant principles that influence human judgments, but fail to generalize these findings to ""real world"" situations that place these principles in conflict. The recently released Moral Machine dataset allows us to build a powerful model that can predict the outcomes of these conflicts while remaining simple enough to explain the basis behind human decisions.

11,Forecasting the 2017-2018 Yemen Cholera Outbreak with Machine Learning,"['Rohil Badkundri', 'Victor Valbuena', 'Srikusmanjali Pinnamareddy', 'Brittney Cantrell', 'Janet Standeven']","The ongoing Yemen cholera outbreak has been deemed one of the worst cholera outbreaks in history, with over a million people impacted and thousands dead. Triggered by a civil war, the outbreak has been shaped by various political, environmental, and epidemiological factors and continues to worsen. While cholera has several effective treatments, the untimely and inefficient distribution of existing medicines has been the primary cause of cholera mortality. With the hope of facilitating resource allocation, various mathematical models have been created to track the Yemeni outbreak and identify at-risk administrative divisions, called governorates. Existing models are not powerful enough to accurately and consistently forecast cholera cases per governorate over multiple timeframes. To address the need for a complex, reliable model, we offer the Cholera Artificial Learning Model (CALM); a system of 4 extreme-gradient-boosting (XGBoost) machine learning models that forecast the number of new cholera cases a Yemeni governorate will experience from a time range of 2 weeks to 2 months. CALM provides a novel machine learning approach that makes use of rainfall data, past cholera cases and deaths data, civil war fatalities, and inter-governorate interactions represented across multiple time frames. Additionally, the use of machine learning, along with extensive feature engineering, allows CALM to easily learn complex non-linear relations apparent in an epidemiological phenomenon. CALM is able to forecast cholera incidence 2 weeks to 2 months in advance within a margin of just 5 cholera cases per 10,000 people in real-world simulation.

12,Prediction of Porosity and Permeability Alteration based on Machine Learning Algorithms,"['Andrei Erofeev', 'Denis Orlov', 'Alexey Ryzhov', 'Dmitry Koroteev']","The objective of this work is to study the applicability of various Machine Learning algorithms for prediction of some rock properties which geoscientists usually define due to special lab analysis. We demonstrate that these special properties can be predicted only basing on routine core analysis (RCA) data. To validate the approach core samples from the reservoir with soluble rock matrix components (salts) were tested within 100+ laboratory experiments. The challenge of the experiments was to characterize the rate of salts in cores and alteration of porosity and permeability after reservoir desalination due to drilling mud or water injection. For these three measured characteristics, we developed the relevant predictive models, which were based on the results of RCA and data on coring depth and top and bottom depths of productive horizons. To select the most accurate Machine Learning algorithm a comparative analysis has been performed. It was shown that different algorithms work better in different models. However, two hidden layers Neural network has demonstrated the best predictive ability and generalizability for all three rock characteristics jointly. The other algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine and Linear Regression, also worked well on the dataset, but in particular cases. Overall, the applied approach allows predicting the alteration of porosity and permeability during desalination in porous rocks and also evaluating salt concentration without direct measurements in a laboratory. This work also shows that developed approaches could be applied for prediction of other rock properties (residual brine and oil saturations, relative permeability, capillary pressure, and others), which laboratory measurements are time-consuming and expensive.

13,Learning Compositional Representations of Interacting Systems with Restricted Boltzmann Machines: Comparative Study of Lattice Proteins,"['Jérôme Tubiana', 'Simona Cocco', 'Rémi Monasson']","A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is an unsupervised machine-learning bipartite graphical model that jointly learns a probability distribution over data and extracts their relevant statistical features. As such, RBM were recently proposed for characterizing the patterns of coevolution between amino acids in protein sequences and for designing new sequences. Here, we study how the nature of the features learned by RBM changes with its defining parameters, such as the dimensionality of the representations (size of the hidden layer) and the sparsity of the features. We show that for adequate values of these parameters, RBM operate in a so-called compositional phase in which visible configurations sampled from the RBM are obtained by recombining these features. We then compare the performance of RBM with other standard representation learning algorithms, including Principal or Independent Component Analysis, autoencoders (AE), variational auto-encoders (VAE), and their sparse variants. We show that RBM, due to the stochastic mapping between data configurations and representations, better capture the underlying interactions in the system and are significantly more robust with respect to sample size than deterministic methods such as PCA or ICA. In addition, this stochastic mapping is not prescribed a priori as in VAE, but learned from data, which allows RBM to show good performance even with shallow architectures. All numerical results are illustrated on synthetic lattice-protein data, that share similar statistical features with real protein sequences, and for which ground-truth interactions are known.

14,Private Inner Product Retrieval for Distributed Machine Learning,"['Mohammad Hossein Mousavi', 'Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali', 'Mahtab Mirmohseni']","In this paper, we argue that in many basic algorithms for machine learning, including support vector machine (SVM) for classification, principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and regression for dependency estimation, we need the inner products of the data samples, rather than the data samples themselves.
  Motivated by the above observation, we introduce the problem of private inner product retrieval for distributed machine learning, where we have a system including a database of some files, duplicated across some non-colluding servers. A user intends to retrieve a subset of specific size of the inner products of the data files with minimum communication load, without revealing any information about the identity of the requested subset. For achievability, we use the algorithms for multi-message private information retrieval. For converse, we establish that as the length of the files becomes large, the set of all inner products converges to independent random variables with uniform distribution, and derive the rate of convergence. To prove that, we construct special dependencies among sequences of the sets of all inner products with different length, which forms a time-homogeneous irreducible Markov chain, without affecting the marginal distribution. We show that this Markov chain has a uniform distribution as its unique stationary distribution, with rate of convergence dominated by the second largest eigenvalue of the transition probability matrix. This allows us to develop a converse, which converges to a tight bound in some cases, as the size of the files becomes large. While this converse is based on the one in multi-message private information retrieval, due to the nature of retrieving inner products instead of data itself some changes are made to reach the desired result.

In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting and identifying Internet trolls, almost all of which are human agents. Identifying a human agent among a human population presents significant challenges compared to detecting automated spam or computerized robots. To learn a troll's behavior, we use contextual anomaly detection to profile each chat user. Using clustering and distance-based methods, we use contextual data such as the group's current goal, the current time, and the username to classify each point as an anomaly. A user whose features significantly differ from the norm will be classified as a troll. We collected 38 million data points from the viral Internet fad, Twitch Plays Pokemon. Using clustering and distance-based methods, we develop heuristics for identifying trolls. Using MapReduce techniques for preprocessing and user profiling, we are able to classify trolls based on 10 features extracted from a user's lifetime history.

We also discuss the relation between the usual measures of performance in Machine Learning, such as AUC or accuracy, with the more adept measure of Asimov significance. This relation is particularly relevant when parametrising systematic uncertainties. Our results show the potential of incorporating Machine Learning techniques to the SMEFT studies using the current datasets.

Faraggi', 'Glyn Harries', 'Benjamin Percival', 'John Rizos']","Systematic classification of Z2xZ2 orbifold compactifications of the heterotic-string was pursued by using its free fermion formulation. The method entails random generation of string vacua and analysis of their entire spectra, and led to discovery of spinor-vector duality and three generation exophobic string vacua. The classification was performed for string vacua with unbroken SO(10) GUT symmetry, and progressively extended to models in which the SO(10) symmetry is broken to the SO(6)xSO(4), SU(5)xU(1), SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)^2 and SU(3)xU(1)xSU(2)^2 subgroups. Obtaining sizeable number of phenomenologically viable vacua in the last two cases requires identification of fertility conditions. Adaptation of machine learning tools to identify the fertility conditions will be useful when the frequency of viable models becomes exceedingly small in the total space of vacua.

  The analysis of the rich body of existing literature on link quality estimation that uses models built from data traces indicates that the techniques used for modeling are becoming increasingly complex. Several recent estimators use machine learning techniques that require a complex design and development process, and each step of this process has the potential to significantly impact the final performance.
  The aim of this paper is to provide an in-depth study of how each step in the process of designing and developing a link quality estimator based on machine learning techniques affects its overall performance. Based on the analysis of the state-of-the-art, we selected a representative subset of machine learning models used in the literature and a representative publicly available dataset. We then performed a systematic study on the influence of the design decisions taken in each step of the machine learning process on the performance of machine learning-based link quality estimators. The results indicate that measurement data preprocessing and feature engineering have a higher influence on the performance of the model than the choice of the algorithm, calling for cautious use and parameterization of the algorithm.

The area under the receiver operating characteristics of the classifier was 0.92, the precision was 0.92 and the recall was 0.84. Codes representing the learned feature space of trained classifier were visualized using t-SNE embedding and were separable and distinguished between images from critically ill and non-septic patients. Using an unsupervised convolutional autoencoder, independent of the clinical diagnosis, we also report clustering of learned features from a compressed representation associated with healthy images and those with microcirculatory dysfunction. The feature space used by our trained classifier to distinguish between images from septic and non-septic patients has potential diagnostic application.

We investigate the generalizing and interpretability properties of learning algorithms. To this end, we use supervised and unsupervised learning to infer the phase boundaries of the active Ising model, starting from an ensemble of configurations of the system. We illustrate that unsupervised learning techniques are powerful at identifying the phase boundaries in the control parameter space, even in situations of phase coexistence. It is demonstrated that supervised learning with neural networks is capable of learning the characteristics of the phase diagram, such that the knowledge obtained at a limited set of control variables can be used to determine the phase boundaries across the phase diagram. In this way, we show that properly designed supervised learning provides predictive power to regions in the phase diagram that are not included in the training phase of the algorithm. We stress the importance of introducing interpretability methods in order to perform a physically relevant classification of the phases with deep learning.

A decoder based on machine learning is considered as one of the most viable solutions for this purpose, since its prediction is fast once training has been done, and it is applicable to any quantum error correcting code and any noise model. So far, various formulations of the decoding problem as the task of machine learning have been proposed. Here, we discuss general constructions of machine-learning-based decoders. We found several conditions to achieve near-optimal performance, and proposed a criterion which should be optimized when a size of training data set is limited. We also discuss preferable constructions of neural networks, and proposed a decoder using spatial structures of topological codes using a convolutional neural network. We numerically show that our method can improve the performance of machine-learning-based decoders in various topological codes and noise models.
